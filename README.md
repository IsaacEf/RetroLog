### Frontend Setup

Be sure to have the latest version of npm installed

`$ npm install -g npm`

Check the version and ensure it matches

`$ node -v
 $ npm -v`

Now navigate to `RetroLog/frontend/src` and run 

`$ npm run build`

This will create the build folder and now the backend has to be ran.

### Backend Setup

Be sure to have the most recent version of Golang installed.

To start the webserver navigate to the `RetroLog/backend/` folder and run 

`$ go run main.go`

## Website

The website will run on port 8000 so navigate to `localhost:8000` on any browser and the website will be visible.
